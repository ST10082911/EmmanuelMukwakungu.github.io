My name is Emmanuel Mukwakungu. I am a final-year Bachelor of Computer Application student at Varsity College. 
My journey in software development began at Varsity College, where I studied for a year and
graduated with distinctions in my modules for a Higher Certificate in IT Support Services.
While pursuing my bachelor's degree, I am steadily developing my programming and collaboration skills,
aiming to become a proficient game developer.
